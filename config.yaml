# Replace the values in the fields below with your own info so the scraper can send out emails.

# "sender" is the email address that will be sending out the emails. I made a throwaway gmail account for this.
# "password" is the password for the sender account.
# "receiver" is the email address that the sender email account will be sending the email to.
# "smtp server" is the smtp server the sender email account uses. If the sender email is a gmail address you do not need to change this.
# "smtp port" is the port the above smtp server uses. If the sender email is a gmail address you do not need to change this.
